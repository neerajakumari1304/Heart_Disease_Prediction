📄 Heart Disease Prediction
📌 Overview
This project predicts the likelihood of heart disease using multiple machine learning models. It includes data preprocessing, feature scaling, balancing with SMOTE, model training, evaluation using ROC‑AUC, and saving the best performing model for inference. A simple web interface (Flask + HTML templates) is also provided for user interaction.
